# This is my first experience with web design.

I am using this repository as I explore my first steps setting up a web server and working with web design.

The goal is to have by the end of this project a well designed website, which will server as my personal page to promote myself from a personal, as well as professional perspective.

The website will be hosted on my Raspberry Pi, therefore I will work on it both from a backend as well as front end perspective.
